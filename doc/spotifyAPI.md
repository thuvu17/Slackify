# Spotify API
Getting started:
- Require API authorization to obtain an access token
- Use access token in API requests
- Spotify implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework:
    - End User corresponds to the Spotify user, who grants access to the protected resources (e.g. playlists, personal information, etc.)
    - Slackify is the client that requests access to the protected resources (e.g a mobile or web app)
    - Server which hosts the protected resources and provides authentication and authorization via OAuth 2.0.
